## 🚀 Project Overview

This project utilizes the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** object detection model, known for its high speed and precision. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset for license plate detection. The front-end is built using **Flask**, offering a user-friendly web interface for real-time image or video-based detection.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Real-Time Detection** – Detects license plates from video streams or uploaded images instantly.  
- **🎯 Custom Model Training** – Fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for enhanced accuracy on license plate datasets.  
- **🌐 Web Interface** – Intuitive Flask-based UI for interaction.  
- **🧪 Python 3.11 Compatible** – Fully compatible with Python 3.11 environment.
